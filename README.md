# Wallpaper Panic [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
Have you ever wanted a quick way to temporarily change your wallpaper to
something normal? Then this script is for you!

### Compatibility
**WIP, not working yet!**

Wallpaper Panic is written in bash, which should be installed by default in
most Unix-based operating systems.

The major compatibility problem is that I have not found a way to change
wallpapers in a way that is desktop environment agnostic, which means only
a few of them are supported. Contributions are welcome for people of other
environments.

Planned to work on:
- Xfce
- GNOME
- KDE

### Usage
