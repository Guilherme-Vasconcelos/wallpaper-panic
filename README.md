# Wallpaper Panic [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
A script which allows you to temporarily switch your wallpaper.

### Installation

- Copy the `src/wallpaper-panic.sh` file to ~/scripts/ (or any other directory that is
in your path).
- Give current user permission to execute it: `chmod +x /path/to/wallpaper-panic.sh`
- Rename the script if you want to. Recommended to rename it to something shorter,
as this is the command you will need to type to execute it.
- Set a shortcut to execute it. If using Xfce, open the Keyboard application and
go to the Application Shortcuts tab.
- Nitrogen

### Compatibility

**WIP, not working yet!**

Wallpaper Panic is written in bash, which should be installed by default in
most Unix-based operating systems.

Unfortunately I have not found a desktop environment agnostic way to change
wallpaper, so currently it only works on Xfce.
