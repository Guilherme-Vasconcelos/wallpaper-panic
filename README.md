# Wallpaper Panic [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A script which allows you to temporarily switch your wallpaper.

There are two scripts: setup.sh (used during the installation) and wpan.sh (the wallpaper-panic itself).

### Installation

Download the src/setup.sh file and execute it.

Not all steps are automated, but the script will guide you if you need to do anything manually.

### Usage

Run `wpan.sh` to change your wallpaper. Then run it again to change it back.

### Compatibility

wallpaper-panic is written in bash, which is installed by default in most (if not all) Unix-based
operating systems.

It also uses Nitrogen to change wallpapers, which only works with GNU/Linux distributions that
use X windows (if you don't know that is, you are probably using it, so don't worry).

In short, if you followed the installation instructions it should work in most environments.
